To install a custom build:

* Copy the contents of ~\SLK\Solution to C:\Install on your server.  Note: this will copy Debug and Release bits and by default DeploySolution.cmd will install Debug if it's available.  This is good because it makes debugging easier.
* Follow the Getting Started Guide to install.
